#Winchester

Winchester is a refined, tasteful, theme for the [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) blogging platform. It derives its inspiration from classical print typography&mdash;it's meant to evoke a beautifully typeset book. The goal is to create a straightforward, fast experience with an air of sophistication for your readers.

As Ghost evolves, so too will Winchester.

##Styles

The theme's styles are built using Sass, and the Sass-inclined will hopefully find customization fairly straightforward. Styles can be also customized with **custom.css**.

##Partials

Many users will want to add comments using a service like [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) or [Livefyre](http://web.livefyre.com/). Code for such services can be added to the partial **comments.hbs**.

Google Analytics code, and alternate fonts if desired, can be added to **header-scripts.hbs**.

Additional JavaScript can be linked/added in **footer-scripts.hbs**.
